# Current Time Stamps

You’ve heard about the ‘time’ library in Python which allows us to manage with time and dates, right? Python has a vast set of libraries which makes the programming language open source and special, today we will see Pendulum Library Python|Current time-stamps.

Most of us are curious to know the time in any far country and we often search it, right? Some may look for it purposely while some for fun or information or curiosity like I said.
